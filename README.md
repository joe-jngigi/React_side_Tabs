# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## How does the code render the Tabs?

After fetching the data, the application can display specific data for a job when you click on a button due to the way the `value` state variable is updated within the `onClick` event handler of each job button.

Let's break down how this works:

1. **Button Click Event**:
   - Each job button generated by the `map` function has an `onClick` event handler attached to it. When you click on a button, this event handler is triggered.

2. **Updating the Value State**:
   - Within the `onClick` event handler, the `setValue` function is called with the `index` of the job as an argument. This `index` corresponds to the position of the job within the `jobs` array.
   - By updating the `value` state variable with the index of the clicked job, the component re-renders, and the `title`, `company`, `dates`, and `duties` for the selected job are displayed.

3. **Rendering Job Information**:
   - In the JSX code, the `title`, `company`, `dates`, and `duties` variables are assigned based on the `value` state variable.
   - When the `value` state variable changes (due to a button click), these variables are updated with the corresponding values for the selected job.
   - As a result, the job information displayed in the UI updates dynamically based on which job button you click.

In summary, by updating the `value` state variable with the index of the selected job, the application knows which job's details to display, and this allows it to show specific data for the clicked job.
